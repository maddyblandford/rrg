Red River Gorge National Geological Area

I have actually never been to Red River Gorge, but the place I have heard the most about is the Natural Bridge. That is number one place that I would like to. I also would love to enjoy Miguel's pizza after the hike because that is another place I have heard a lot about.  

## Part II requirements:
```text
1. Add a title to your page using an Heading 1 tag (#).
2. Do a little research about the Red River Gorge and describe two facts about this area.
3. Put a Heading 2 tag (##) with a good title before each text block.
4. Provide one link to an interesting map you find online.
5. Add one photograph.
6. Add your name and the sources you used for reference.
```

## Part III is done!

[https://maddyblandford.github.io/rrg/](https://maddyblandford.github.io/rrg/) works as expected!
